# Day 1 – Advanced JavaScript (Async)

Building asynchronous JavaScript concepts on top of strong JavaScript fundamentals.

## Objective
To understand how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations and why
callbacks, promises, and async/await are essential for building
non-blocking and responsive applications.

## Topics Covered
- JavaScript non-blocking behavior
- Callbacks and callback functions
- Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom)
- Promises and promise chaining
- async / await syntax
- Fetch API for HTTP requests

## Files Overview
- `callback.js` – Basic example of callback usage
- `callback-hell.js` – Demonstrates nested callbacks and callback hell
- `promise.js` – Handling async operations using Promises
- `async-await.js` – Cleaner asynchronous code using async/await
- `fetch-api.js` – Making API calls using Fetch API

## Key Learnings
- JavaScript is single-threaded but handles async tasks using the event loop
- Callback hell makes code difficult to read and maintain
- Promises improve readability and error handling
- async/await simplifies asynchronous logic
- Fetch API returns a Promise and is commonly used for API communication

## Outcome
This day helped me clearly understand asynchronous JavaScript concepts
and prepared me to apply them in DOM manipulation, React, and
real-world frontend applications.
