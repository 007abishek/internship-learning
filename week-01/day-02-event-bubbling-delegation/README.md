# Day 2 – Event Bubbling & Event Delegation

## Objective
To understand how browser events propagate and how event delegation
improves performance and code structure.

## Concepts Practiced
- Event bubbling
- stopPropagation
- event.target vs event.currentTarget
- Event delegation

## Key Learnings
- Events bubble from child to parent
- Bubbling can be controlled using stopPropagation
- Event delegation uses bubbling to handle events efficiently
- One parent listener can handle multiple child elements

## Outcome
This practice helped me understand how real frontend frameworks
like React manage events efficiently.
