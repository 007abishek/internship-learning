# Day 1 – JavaScript Fundamentals

## Objective
To build a strong foundation in JavaScript by understanding
core concepts before moving to asynchronous programming
and frontend frameworks like React.

## Topics Covered
- Variables and scope (`let`, `const`)
- Data types (primitive & non-primitive)
- Operators and conditional statements
- Functions and arrow functions
- Arrays and array methods
- Objects and nested objects
- Value vs Reference
- Shallow copy vs Deep copy (immutability basics)

## Folder Overview
Each file in this folder focuses on one JavaScript concept
with simple examples and clear comments for better understanding.

## Key Learnings
- Primitive values are copied by value, objects by reference
- Immutability helps avoid unintended side effects
- JavaScript behavior in memory is critical for React state updates

## Outcome
This day helped me gain confidence in JavaScript fundamentals
and prepared me for advanced asynchronous JavaScript concepts.
